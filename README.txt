           Battery-powered walk path sensor
 for clinical trials of therapies for movement disorders

  This is a small (4" x 4" 1.6") battery-powered wireless sensor that,
  when used in a pair on opposite sides of a walking path, detects someone
  walking thorugh an IR beam between the sensors. It then sends a Bluetooth
  alert to a mobile phone or tablet.

  The custom-built sensor hardware consist of:
  - Adafruit Bluefruit Feather 32U4 AVR microcontroller with Bluetooth LE module
  - 940nm IR LED transmitter powered by a constant-current driver
  - 940nm 38 Khz tuned IR receiver
  - red/green battery status light
  - blue and yellow operational status lights
  - power on/off pushbutton
  - program-controlled power supply circuit
  - 4-cell AA battery holder
